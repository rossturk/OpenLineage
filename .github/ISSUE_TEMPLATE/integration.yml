      description: Please provide details about your proposed integration

      label: Will this be implemented within the target system?
      description: Ideally, target systems would emit OpenLineage metadata using a push mechanism. However, sometimes integrations are implemented as plugins that live within the OpenLineage repository.
      options:
        - label: This integration will be carried out in the target system
        - label: This integration will be done in the OpenLineage repo
        - label: This integration will be done somewhere else

      label: Do you plan to make this contribution yourself?
      description: This is absolutely not required. However, if you are interested in working on this project the community would be happy to help you. If not, that's ok too!
      options:
        - label: I am interested in doing this work
